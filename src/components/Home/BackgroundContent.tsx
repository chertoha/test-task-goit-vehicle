          Although campervanning is popular throughout the world, nowhere is it more engrained in
          the culture than in the United States! The US is the perfect place to rent a campervan or
          RV and hit the road. The idea of the iconic American road trips still attracts people from
          far and wide, all wanting to experience the splendor of its many landscapes. Curiosity
          draws in local and international crowds to all the wonders that can be found throughout
          the country. The US has a great sense of adventure and a love for the outdoors, making it
          the perfect place to enjoy a road trip. o drive one of our many vehicles, you will need to
          be at least 21 years old and hold a standard driving license. In case you are not a US
          citizen and you want to travel here, make sure to check which type of visa you will be
          needing to enter the country.

        <p className="body-1 leading-loose">
          Traveling in a campervan unlocks the freedom to create your adventure. With Europe as your
          playground during the Euro Cup, explore host cities, charming villages, and scenic
          landscapes at your own pace. Whether it’s catching a match in a bustling metropolis or
          unwinding in the tranquillity of nature, the choice is entirely yours. Also, the Euro Cup
          will take place in one of Europe’s premier campervan destinations: Germany, known for its
          camping culture, with its numerous campsites, well-maintained roads, and scenic routes,
          the country boasts an impressive 16 national parks and 98 nature reserves to explore. On
          our 5th day, we started by visiting Lago di Carezza, a stunning lake that offers a short
          and easy walk around it. Next, we explored the vast meadow of Alpe di Siusi or Seiser Alm,
          known for its incredible scenery and outdoor activities. A curiosity: it’s a ski resort in
          winter and spring! To avoid the cable car, it’s important to arrive before 9 am, as the
          car park is only available when the cable car isn’t running. For an unforgettable
          experience, consider renting an electric bike, although it comes at an expense, as it
          allows you to fully enjoy the beauty of Alpe di Siusi.

          First, I visited Lago di Braies, the region’s most famous lake. Its scenic beauty and the
          surrounding landscape make it a must-see. Due to limited parking for campervans, we parked
          in the nearest village and took a 6€ bus to the lake. The walk around the lake takes
          approximately an hour, so don’t miss the chance to have a picnic on its shores. Afterward,
          we headed for the Rifugio Aronzo, located at an altitude of over 2000 meters. The mountain
          hut is the starting point for two famous trails, the Cadini di Misurina, a moderately easy
          walk with breathtaking views. And the Tre Cime de Lavaredo, one of the postcards of the
          Dolomites, and a slightly more challenging trail. We did the Cadini di Misurina trail in
          the late afternoon, which made us experience a wonderful sunset, and then spent the night
          in the parking area ready for more hiking the next day!

          As the demand for hotels and popular vacation rental platforms surges, so do their
          prices—often reaching a considerable premium, especially when near the Stadium. Sure,
          having a room right next to the stadium sounds like a dream, but let’s talk reality: it
          comes with a hefty price tag.
